These are dynamic descreiptive dashboards created using Impact Cloud, the data is connected to google sheets using Airbyte.
We can perform PostgreSQL queries, insert photos, videos within Impact Cloud to perform data cleasing, analysis, visualizaions and build the dashboards according to entrepreneurs' needs and data.
